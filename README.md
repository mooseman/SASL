A simple and educational compiler for the SASL programming language.



Acknowledgement and thanks
========================== 

Dan Piponi (sigfpe) is the author of the SASL compiler here. 

He has very generously said in reply to my comment [here](http://blog.sigfpe.com/2017/06/a-relaxation-technique.html#comments) that I can do what I like with his code, and is happy for it to be released as "public domain". 
Thank you very much for that, Dan! 


So, with that in mind, I release the code in this fork as "public domain".
